    <p>Turkey is an upper-middle-income country and an emerging market.[323][350] A founding member of the OECD and G20, it is the 18th-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP, and the 11th-largest by PPP. It is classified among newly industrialized countries. Services account for the majority of GDP, whereas industry accounts for more than 30%.[351] Agriculture contributes about 7%.[351] According to IMF estimates, Turkey's GDP per capita by PPP is $42,064 in 2023, while its nominal GDP per capita is $12,849.[8] Foreign direct investment in Turkey peaked at $22.05 billion in 2007 and dropped to $13.09 billion in 2022.[352]</p>

    <p>Turkey is a diversified economy; main industries include automobiles, electronics, textiles, construction, steel, mining, and food processing.[351] It is a major agricultural producer.[353] Turkey ranks 8th in crude steel production, 13th in ship building (by tonnage), and 13th in motor vehicle production in the world.[354] Turkish automative companies include TEMSA, Otokar, BMC and Togg. Togg is the first all-electric vehicle company of Turkey. Arçelik, Vestel, and Beko are major manufacturers of consumer electronics.[355] Arçelik is one of the largest producers of household goods in the world.[356] In 2022, Turkey ranked second in the world in terms of the number of international contractors in top 250 list.[357] It is also the fifth largest in the world in terms of textile exports.[358] Turkish Airlines is one of largest airlines in the world.</p>
    <p>Between 2007 and 2021, the share of population below the PPP-$6.85 per day international poverty threshold declined from 20% to 7.6%.[323] In 2023, 13.9% of the population was below the national at-risk-of-poverty rate.[359] In 2021, 34% of the population were at risk of poverty or social exclusion, using Eurostat definition.[360] Unemployment in Turkey was 10.4% in 2022.[361] In 2021, it was estimated that 47% of total disposable income was received by the top 20% of income earners, while the lowest 20% received only 6%.[362]</p>

    <p>Turkey is the 16th largest electricity producer in the world. Turkey's energy generation capacity increased significantly, with electricity generation from renewable sources tripling in the past decade.[367][368] It produced 43.8% of its electricity from such sources in 2019.[369] Turkey is also the fourth-largest producer of geothermal power in the world.[370] Turkey’s first nuclear power station, Akkuyu, will increase diversification of its energy mix.[371] When it comes to total final consumption, fossil fuels still play a large role, accounting for 73%.[372] A major reason of Turkey’s greenhouse gas emissions is the large proportion of coal in the energy system.[373] As of 2017, while the government had invested in low carbon energy transition, fossil fuels were still subsidized.[374] By 2053, Turkey aims to have net zero emissions.[375]</p>
    <p>Turkey has made security of its energy supply a top priority, given its heavy reliance on gas and oil imports.[376] Turkey’s main energy supply sources are Russia, West Asia, and Central Asia.[377] Gas production began in 2023 in the recently-discovered Sakarya gas field. When fully operational, it will supply about 30% of the natural gas needed domestically.[378][379] Turkey aims to become a hub for regional energy transportation.[380] Several oil and gas pipelines span the country, including the Blue Stream, TurkStream, and Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipelines.[380]</p>
    <p>As of 2023, Turkey has 3,726 kilometers of controlled-access highways and 29,373 kilometers of divided highways.[381] Multiple bridges and tunnels connect Asian and European sides of Turkey; the Çanakkale 1915 Bridge on the Dardanelles strait is the longest suspension bridge in the world.[382] Marmaray and Eurasia tunnels under the Bosporus connect both sides of Istanbul.[383] The Osman Gazi Bridge connects the northern and southern shores of the Gulf of İzmit.</p>
    <p>Turkish State Railways operates both conventional and high speed trains, with the government expanding both.[384] High-speed rail lines include the Ankara-Istanbul, Ankara-Konya, and Ankara-Sivas routes.[385] Istanbul Metro is the largest subway network in the country with around 704 million annual ridership in 2019.[386] There are 115 airports as of 2024.[387] Istanbul Airport is one of the top 10 busiest airports in the world. Turkey aims to become a transportation hub.[388][389] It is part of various routes that connect Asia and Europe, including the Middle Corridor.[389] In 2024, Turkey, Iraq, UAE, and Qatar signed an agreement to link Iraqi port facilities to Turkey via road and rail connections.[390]</p>

    <p>TÜBİTAK is one of the main agencies for funding and carrying out research.[396][397] Turkey's space program plans to develop a national satellite launch system, and to improve capabilities in space exploration, astronomy, and satellite communication.[397] Under the Göktürk Program, Turkish Space Systems, Integration and Test Center was built.[398] Turkey's first communication satellite manufactured domestically, Türksat 6A, will be launched in 2024.[399] As part of a planned particle accelerator center, an electron accelerator called TARLA became operational in 2024.[400][401] An Antarctic research station is planned on Horseshoe Island.[402]</p>
    <p>Turkey is considered a significant power in unmanned aerial vehicles.[403] Aselsan, Turkish Aerospace Industries, Roketsan, and Asfat are among the top 100 defense companies in the world.[404] Turkish defense companies spend a significant portion of their budgets for research and development.[405]</p>
